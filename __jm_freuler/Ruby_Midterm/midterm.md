##MIDTERM  REQUIREMENTS

Create a command line based application that fulfills these criteria:

-  Takes user input and handles bad input (i.e. You expect numbers and they give you a letter).

gets
give menu 1-5
They put a letter, expects only numbers... can't do that, you were meant to ...

-	Connects to a 3rd party api where the call varies based on what the user gives you.

reddit
figure out to pass new parameters to them
Read into the APIs. Twitter API gem is good example
Tuesdays execrise. I can give you these stories. Enter 1 for reddit, enter 2 for mashable, etc. 
Or give them sth to search for on twitter --> string. I want to look for all twtitter tweets that say "cat". Pass that parameter 

-	Must be object oriented. You must instantiate modeled classes. The only file that can run without classes is your runner.

require relative
Class Mytwitter
require gem (if twitter gem)

-	Push code on Github.
