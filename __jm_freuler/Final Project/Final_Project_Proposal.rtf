\f0\fs24 \cf0 Final Project\
\
Build an application that allows users to browse through books that received a prestigious award, such as the Man Booker Prize, Pulitzer Price, etc.  \
\
Each book will have reviews by 3 critics. Their bio will show as well. \
\
If the user likes the book, he/she can click on "Buy" and buy it online or from Amazon and I get a commission on the purchase. \
